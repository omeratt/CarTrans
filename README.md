# TransCar: Unleashing the Future of Car Ownership Transfers with NextJS and Solidity Blockchain

## Introduction
TransCar aims to revolutionize the current car ownership transfer processes, which are often inefficient and time-consuming. By leveraging NextJS and Solidity Blockchain, TransCar offers a decentralized application that allows users to securely transfer car ownership through smart contracts. Say goodbye to paperwork and long waiting times!

## Problem Statement
Current car ownership transfer processes are inefficient and time-consuming.

## How TransCar Works
TransCar is a decentralized application built on Next.js and Solidity. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. Users create a contract by providing the buyer's wallet address, third-party wallet address, the price in "MATIC," and the car brand.
2. Once created, the contract is sent to both the buyer and the owner (seller).
3. The buyer confirms the payment, and the owner confirms the delivery of car keys.
4. The third party verifies the contract before sending the payment to the owner.
5. Contracts can be canceled by both the buyer and the owner if neither the payment nor the keys have been delivered yet. In such cases, the owner will receive their money back.

## Benefits of TransCar
TransCar offers several benefits:

- Efficiency: Transfer ownership in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods.
- Transparency: Immutable records on the blockchain ensure transparency and accountability.
- Security: Blockchain technology prevents fraud and provides a secure transfer process.

## NextJS and Solidity Blockchain
TransCar utilizes NextJS for the user-friendly frontend, providing a seamless experience. Solidity Blockchain ensures secure and transparent ownership transfers by leveraging smart contracts and decentralized technology.
